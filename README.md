# Code-Snippets
This is an opensource collection of code snippets. Feel free to contribute

## Rules:
  - **No deleting files** 
  - Your code doesn't have to be pretty
  - You can use any language
  - If there isn't a folder for the language that you are using then make a folder with the name of the language
  - Have fun 

## I will try to merge all pull requests as soon as possible as long as they are legit.
